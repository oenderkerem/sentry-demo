# sentry-example
This Project is a simple showcase for sentry

There are some showcases that lead to exceptions, which will be handled by Sentry in different ways.

You should change the sentry.dsn property in application.properties to a valid dsn to be able to see how sentry reacts.

Sentry is open source. You can either run it locally or create a free account to test it.
